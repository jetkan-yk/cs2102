<p>The objective of this team project is for you to apply what you have learned in class to design and develop a database application
using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html">PostgreSQL</a>.
The project is to be done in teams of four students.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_project_tasks">1. Project Tasks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are to develop a database application for a IT company that conducts training courses.  The project consists of the following five tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Design a ER data model for the application. Your ER model should capture as many of the application&#8217;s constraints as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translate your ER data model into a relational database schema. Your relational schema should enforce as many of the application&#8217;s constraints as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a SQL or PL/pgSQL function/procedure for each of the functionalities listed in  <a href="#_application_functionalities">Application Functionalities</a>.
You should implement appropriate triggers (if necessary) to enforce all the application&#8217;s constraints.
You may use any of the PostgreSQL&#8217;s features and any SQL or PL/pgSQL constructs beyond what is covered in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Populate each table in your database with synthetic data.  Each table should have at least 10 records.
You may use online data generators (e.g., <a href="https://mockaroo.com" class="bare">https://mockaroo.com</a>, <a href="https://www.generatedata.com" class="bare">https://www.generatedata.com</a>)  or write your own scripts to generate the synthetic data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each table R in your database schema that is not in 3NF, find a dependency-preserving BCNF decomposition  of R if it exists;
if not, find a 3NF decomposition of R.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2 id="_application">2. Application</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The company conducts various one-day IT courses throughout the year.
Each course has a unique course identifier, a unique course title (e.g., 'Advanced SQL'), a course description, a course area (e.g., Database Systems, Networking), and a duration (in terms of number of hours).
Each course could be offered multiple times a year.
Each course offering has the following information:
course fees,
a target number of registrations,
launch date for the offering,
and
registration deadline for the offering.
The offerings for the same course have different launch dates.
Each course offering is handled by an administrator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each course offering consists of one or more sessions,
where each session is conducted by an instructor on a specific weekday (Monday to Friday) at a specific hour  in some lecture room within the company.
There could be multiple instructors assigned to conduct the different sessions for a course offering.
The earliest session can start at 9am and the latest session (for each day) must end by 6pm, and no sessions are conducted
between 12pm to 2pm.
The sessions for a course offering are numbered consecutively starting from 1; we refer to these as <strong>session numbers</strong>.
No two sessions for the same course offering can be conducted on the same day and at the same time.
Each course offering has a <strong>start date</strong> and an <strong>end date</strong>
that is determined by the dates of its earliest and latest sessions, respectively.
As an example, a course offering which consists of  four sessions conducted on March 8 at 10am, March 8 at 3pm, March 11 at 11am, and March 12 at 3pm
would have a start date of March 8 and an end date of March 12.
The registration deadline for a course offering must be at least 10 days before its start date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each course offered by the company, a customer can register for at most one of its sessions before its registration deadline.
The seating capacity of a course session is equal to the seating capacity of the room where the session is conducted,
and
the seating capacity of a course offering is equal to the sum of the seating capacities of its sessions.
A course offering is said to be <strong>available</strong> if the number of registrations received is no more than its seating capacity;
otherwise, we say that a course offering is <strong>fully booked</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Customers could also purchase promotional course packages sold by  the company.
Each course package allows a customer to register free-of-charge for  a fixed number of course sessions which can be redeemed  for any course offering.
The company may have multiple course packages on sale at any one time.
Each course package has a unique package identifier, a package name, the number of free course sessions,
a start and end date indicating the duration that the promotional package is available for sale, and the price of the package.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A customer&#8217;s course package is classified as either  <strong>active</strong> if there is at least one unused session in the package,
<strong>partially active</strong> if  all the sessions in the package have been redeemed but there is at least one redeemed session that could be refunded if it is cancelled,
or <strong>inactive</strong> otherwise.
Each customer can have at most one active or partially active package.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each registered course, a customer pays for the course fees by either  making a credit card payment
or redeeming a session from his/her active course package.
The date of the registration is recorded in the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a credit card payment, the company&#8217;s cancellation policy will refund 90% of the paid fees for a registered course if the cancellation is made at least 7 days before the day of the registered session;
otherwise, there will no refund for a late cancellation.
For a redeemed course session, the company&#8217;s cancellation policy will credit an extra course session to the customer&#8217;s course package
if the cancellation is made at least 7 days before the day of the registered session; otherwise, there will no refund for a late cancellation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Course packages must be purchased using credit card payment and they can&#8217;t be refunded.
Each course package sold to a customer has
the date of the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each customer has
a unique customer identifier,
name,
home address,
contact number,
email address,
and
information of a credit card (credit card number, expiry date, CVV code).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each lecture room in the company&#8217;s office, the following information is maintained:
its unique room identifier,
its location (in terms of the floor and room numbers),
and
its maximum seating capacity.
Each room can be used to conduct at most one course session at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each employee in the company is either a manager, an administrator, or an instructor.
Each employee has a unique identifier, name, home address, contact number, email address,
salary information,
date that the employee joined the company,
and
date that the employee departed the company (the value is null if an employee is still employed by the company).
All managers and administrators are full-time employees while instructors could be full-time or part-time employees.
Each full-time employee has a fixed monthly salary,
while each part-time instructor has a fixed hourly rate and his/her monthly salary is computed based on the total number of hours worked for that month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each instructor specializes in a set of one or more course areas,
and an instructor who is assigned to teach a course session must be specialized in that course area.
Each instructor can teach at most one course session at any hour.
Each instructor must not be assigned to teach two consecutive course sessions;
i.e., there must be at least one hour of break between any two course sessions
that the instructor is teaching.
Each part-time instructor must not teach more than 30 hours for each month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each manager manages zero or more course areas, and each course area is managed by exactly one manager.
Each course offering is managed by the manager of that course area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of each month, the company pays salaries to its employees.
Each salary payment to a full-time employee has the following information:
date of payment,
number of work days for the month,
monthly salary,
and salary amount.
The  salary amount is given by the product of the employee&#8217;s monthly salary and
the ratio  given by the number of work days for the month to the number of days in the month.
The number of work days for the month is given by (last work day - first work day + 1).
The first work day is equal to day of the employee&#8217;s joined date if the employee&#8217;s joined date is within the month of payment; otherwise, it is equal to 1.
The last work day is equal to day of the employee&#8217;s departed date if the employee&#8217;s departed date is within the month of payment; otherwise, it is equal to the number of days in the month.
Each salary payment to a part-time employee has the following information:
date of payment,
number of work hours for the month,
hourly rate,
and salary amount.
The  salary amount is given by the product of the employee&#8217;s hourly rate and the number of work hours for the month.</p>

<h2 id="_application_functionalities">3. Application Functionalities</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your application must support the following functionalities,
each of which is to be implemented as  a SQL or PL/pgSQL routine (i.e., function or procedure).
Some of these routines return a JSON value.  PostgreSQL provides many useful functions for JSON data type
(e.g., <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html">row_to_json</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html">json_agg</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the specifications for the routines are incomplete by design; for example, the data types for the input parameters are not specified,
and
certain parameters (e.g., course offering identifier) are not explicitly defined.
For any criterion/process/design issue that is not explicitly stated, you are free to decide on how to address that issue in a reasonable way
and justify your decisions in your project report.</p>

start date,
end date,
and
number of packages sold.
The output is sorted in descending order of number of packages sold followed by descending order of price of package.
In the event that there are multiple packages that tie for the top Nth position, all these packages should be included in the output records;
thus, the output table could have more than N records.
It is also possible for the output table to have fewer than N records if N is larger than the number of packages launched this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>popular_courses</strong>:
This routine is used to find the popular courses offered this year (i.e., start date is within this year).
A course is popular if the course has at least two offerings this year,
and for every pair of offerings of the course this year,
the offering with the later start date has a higher number of registrations
than that of the offering with the earlier start date.
The routine returns a table of records consisting of the following information for each popular course:
course identifier,
course title,
course area,
number of offerings this year,
and
number of registrations for the latest offering this year.
The output is sorted in descending order of the number of registrations for the latest offering this year
followed by in ascending order of course identifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>view_summary_report</strong>: This routine is used to view a monthly summary report of the company&#8217;s sales and expenses for a specified number of months.

routine returns a table of records consisting of the following information for each of the last N months (starting from the current month):
month and year,
total salary paid for the month,
total amount of sales of course packages for the month,
total registration fees paid via credit card payment for the month,
total amount of refunded registration fees (due to cancellations) for the month,
and
total number of course registrations  via course package redemptions for the month.
For example, if the number of specified months is 3 and the current month is January 2021,
the output will consist of one record for each of the following three months: January 2021, December 2020, and November 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>view_manager_report</strong>: This routine is used to view a report on the sales generated by each manager.
The routine returns a table of records consisting of the following information for each manager:
manager name,
total number of course areas that are managed by the manager,
total number of course offerings that ended this year (i.e., the course offering&#8217;s end date is within this year) that are managed by the manager,
total net registration fees for all the course offerings that ended this year that are managed by the manager,
the course offering title (i.e., course title) that has the highest total net registration fees among
all the course offerings that ended this year that are managed by the manager; if there are ties, list all these top course offering titles.
The total net registration fees for a course offering is defined
to be the sum of the total registration fees paid for the course offering via credit card payment (excluding any refunded fees due to cancellations)
and the total redemption registration fees  for the course offering.
The redemption registration fees  for a course offering
refers to the registration fees for a course offering that is paid via a redemption from a course package;
this registration fees is given by the price of the course package divided by the number of sessions included in the course package (rounded down to the nearest dollar).
There must be one output record for each manager in the company and the output is to be sorted by ascending order of manager name.</p>
